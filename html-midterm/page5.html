<h1>Page 1 Errors</h1>

- There was no lang attribute to the html start tag so I had to declare the HTML language 
- the header 2 was inside of the table, so I had to close out the <tr> tag by adding </tr> first
then close out the <table> tag by adding </table> to make the header outside of the table

<h1>Page 2 Errors</h1>

<h1>Page 3 Errors</h1>
The document is not set up in the format of a HTML doc type so we should add a language to html,
title and meta,  
- changed title to Mid-term Page 3

<h1>Page 4 Errors</h1>
- There is no starting doc type, so we add <!Doctype html>
