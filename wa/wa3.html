    <p>In Israel, ice cream sandwiches are commonly known as "kasata" (קסטה). Though the name comes from the Italian cassata,

    <h3 id="Singapore"><strong>Singapore</strong></h3>
    <p>Wafer ice cream is popular in Singapore. It is one of the types of potong (cut) ice cream, so named because the servings
        are sliced from a large bar of ice cream. Wafer ice cream consists of two wafers holding together a rectangular block of ice cream.
        Wafer ice cream evolved from the older 'ice potong' type, which is a rectangular prism of ice cream mounted on a wooden stick.
        Many customers complained that the ice potong would easily melt and fall off the stick, leading to the introduction of the wafers
        for better grip. Vendors are commonly found along Orchard Road and Chinatown and outside schools.[4] A colloquial term for
        it is "pia ice cream", which translates to "biscuit ice cream" in the Hokkien dialect.<br>
    
        <br> Common flavours offered include peppermint, chocolate chip, durian,[5] ripple, red bean, yam, sweet corn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(melon)">honeydew</a>, and chocolate.<br>
    
        <br> Wafer ice cream vendors also sell the same blocks of ice cream on slices of multicoloured bread,[5] on cones or in cups instead of sandwiched between wafers.<br>
        
        <br> Catering companies in Singapore also send ice cream sandwich carts for functions.[4]

        sandwiched between two wafers and coated with chocolate around the edges. Typically a vanilla block (or a layer of soft-serve)
        sandwiched between one plain wafer and one chocolate-covered nougat one. This is known as a single nougat" in Scotland, with a
        double nougat (pronounced nugget) having nougat wafers on both sides.[8] Raspberry sauce is also a common topping. Nougat wafers
        came in double or triple varieties, depending on the number of nougat wafers in the construction.
