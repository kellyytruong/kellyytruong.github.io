    <p>Hello! I'm Kelly. I'm from Broomfield, Colorado. I'm a senior 
        majoring in Psychology with minors in CTD and Communication. 
        By the end of this course, my goal is to be able to code my own website 
        and make it into my portfolio. Fun fact, I have over 
        <strong>30</strong> <u>food allergies</u>, but I don't carry an Epipen because I like to 
        live life on the <em>~edge~</em>.</p>
