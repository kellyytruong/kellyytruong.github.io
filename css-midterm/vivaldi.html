            <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor 
        Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic 
        masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery 
        that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through music that 
        manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut. Paul Huang is just the 
        virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert Hall.
        The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on 
        fate that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements, 
        Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art. 
        Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance, movement, 
        and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat. </p>
