            <h1>NOV 4 - 6 (FRI - SAT): 7:30, SUN: 1:00</h1>
            <p>History is replete with turning points and with the completion 
                of his revolutionary Third Symphony, Beethoven forever changed the idea of 
                what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and Romantic eras, 
                the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is 
                larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion 
                rises to the forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, 
                while reimagining a future for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist 
                Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant recipient — brings youthful energy to 
                Elgar’s Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring themes and quiet anguish 
                that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan 
                Williams’ Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable marriage of music and text, 
                with Williams’ inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations. 
                These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your Colorado Symphony. </p>
